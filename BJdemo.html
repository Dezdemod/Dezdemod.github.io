        - Try to get a higher hand value than the dealer's without going over 21 in
        a simple Blackjack game with expected win/lose conditions such as higher
        cards, opponent is bust and draw between opponents.
        <br /><br />
        - Dealer always reveals his second card when the player stands.
        <br /><br />
        - The game detects if the player or dealer has a blackjack at the start
        of the game so you don't need to wait until the end of the round to find out
        who the winner is.
