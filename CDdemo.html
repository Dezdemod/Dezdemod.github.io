        - Project uses the OpenCV library and makes use of its components to detect
        moving balls that pop-up while the game is running, based on their color.
        <br /><br />
        - It works by capturing the game window then storing that information in an 
        image container. The processed frame that gives the information on where 
        to detect the balls is used in drawing the rectangles around the objects on 
        a copy of the unprocessed frame.
        <br /><br />
        - It uses different rectangle colors that match the colors on the balls so
        it's easier to comprehend the distinction that it makes between objects.
