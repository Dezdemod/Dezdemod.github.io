        - The aim of the game is to collect as many objects as possible within the time limit,
        avoiding the enemies while making sure you have enough money to pay your
        expenses, which increase by 90 every 3 levels, up to 500.
        <br /><br />
        - Objects are randomly generated with their own texture, value, collision,
        time bonus and weight while the enemies have their own speed, color and
        collision, adding a lot of variety to the gameplay.
        <br /><br />
        - If you have enough money, you can upgrade your gear at the shop to make 
        your equipment more efficient.
